## Technologies used
- [JAVA](https://www.java.com/) : This is used to implement some of the app functionality.

## Future Releases
The app is still in its development stages and does achieve maximum functionality.
However, with upcoming releases users will be able to search for a song play it, rate it, view the lyrics and share it.
Furthermore, we hope to implement synced lyrics and ultimately a sing-along feature.
